// \verbatim
The DMAC blocks are tested using the following procedure.

  1) A destination block of size 64 bytes is set to 0 with DW transfers using 16 x 32-bit transfers from a fixed address.
  2) The destination block is verified to be all 0.
  3) The same destination block is filled with 00 00 ff by using an 8-bit DMA from a fixed address with an increment of 3 and a length of 22 (64+(3-1))/3.
  4) The destination block is verified to contain the correct pattern (shown below with lowest address first): ff0000ff0000ff0000ff0000ff0000ff0000ff0000ff0000â€¦

****************************************************************************//**
*
* This function writes a pattern (66 bytes) to the destination using the DMA and
* the destination block is verified to contain the correct pattern.
*
*
* \param base
* The pointer to the hardware DMA block <br>
* \param channel
* A channel number
* \param descriptor0
* This is the descriptor to be associated with the channel (transfer 0's to destination).
* \param descriptor1
* This is the descriptor to be associated with the channel (transfer pattern to destination).
* \param des0_config
* This is a configuration structure that has all initialization information for the descriptor.
* \param des1_config
* This is a configuration structure that has all initialization information for the descriptor.
* \param channelConfig
* The structure that has the initialization information for the channel.
* \param trigLine
* The input of the trigger mux.
* -> Bit 30 represents if the signal is an input/output. When this bit is set, the trigger activation is for an output
* trigger from the trigger multiplexer. When this bit is reset, the trigger activation is for an input trigger to the trigger multiplexer. <br>
* -> Bits 12:8 represent the trigger group selection. <br>
* -> In case of output trigger line (bit 30 is set): For PERI_ver1: <br>
* -> Bits 6:0 select the output trigger number in the trigger group. For PERI_ver2: <br>
* -> Bits 7:0 select the output trigger number in the trigger group. In case of input trigger line (bit 30 is unset): <br>
* -> Bits 7:0 select the input trigger signal for the trigger multiplexer  <br>
*
* \note
* Only applicable for CAT1A and CAT1C devices.
